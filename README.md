## The Challenge

In the dynamic world of retail, accurate sales predictions are crucial for optimizing inventory, improving customer satisfaction, and making data-driven decisions. However, with countless factors at play, from product characteristics to store locations, it's a complex puzzle to solve.

## My Solution

I've embarked on a journey to build a robust sales prediction model that considers a multitude of variables. My data preprocessing pipeline handles categorical and numeric features with finesse, including clever strategies for encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling. But I didn't stop there!

## Taking Flight with Flask

To make my predictions accessible and actionable, I've developed a user-friendly Flask web app. Now, anyone can interact with my model, input their data, and get instant sales forecasts â€“ all through a clean and intuitive interface.
